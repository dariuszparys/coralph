Issues JSON is provided at start of context. Parse it to get
open issues with their bodies and comments

# TASK BREAKDOWN

Break down the issues into tasks. An issue may contain a single
task (a small bugfix or visual tweak) or many, many tasks (a PRD
or a large refactor).

Make each task the smalles possible unit of work. We don't want
to outrun our headlights. Aim for one small change per task.

# TASK SELECTION

Pick the next task. Prioritize tasks in this order:

1. Critical bufixes
2. Tracer bullets for new features

Tracer bullets comes from the Pragmatic Programmer. When
building systems, you want to write code that get you feedback
as quickly as possible. Tracer bullets are small slices of
functionality that go through all layers of the system, allowing
you to test and validate your approach early. This helps in
identifying potential issues and ensures that the overall
architecture is sound before investing significant time in
development.

TL;DR - build a tiny, end-to-end slice of te task is not complete, leave a comment on the GitHub issue
with what was done.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
